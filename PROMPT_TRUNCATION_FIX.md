# Prompt Truncation Fix for Perplexity Service

## Critical Problem: 500 Character Limit Was Cutting Off Prompts

### The Issue

**Original Code (Line 407):**
```python
prompt = tweet_content[:500]  # Truncate to 500 chars
```

**What was happening:**
- ANY prompt longer than 500 characters was being **silently truncated**
- Users were losing critical parts of their prompts
- Rules, instructions, and context were being cut off

### Example of the Problem

**Your prompt:**
```
Write a short fact-based impactful, entertaining, fun and amusing response teaching a fresh, complementary insight about the following text in a human-like entertaining language:
        # Content to write the response about:

        'I DON'T KNOW WHO NEEDS TO HEAR THIS...

...but if you are celebrating a 'National Food Program'...

...YOU LIVE IN A 100% FAILED COUNTRY RUN BY FAILED POLITICIANS & RETARDS.'

        # Rules for your response
        1) keep your response less than 500
        2) [MORE RULES]
        3) [MORE RULES]
        4) [MORE RULES]
```

**What Perplexity received (truncated at 500 chars):**
```
Write a short fact-based impactful, entertaining, fun and amusing response teaching a fresh, complementary insight about the following text in a human-like entertaining language:
        # Content to write the response about:

        'I DON'T KNOW WHO NEEDS TO HEAR THIS...

...but if you are celebrating a 'National Food Program'...

...YOU LIVE IN A 100% FAILED COUNTRY RUN BY FAILED POLITICIANS & RETARDS.'

        # Rules for your response
        1) keep your response less than 500
```

**Result:** Rules 2, 3, 4, etc. were completely lost!

## The Fix

### What Changed (Line 407-413)

**Before:**
```python
# Type the prompt
prompt = tweet_content[:500]  # Truncate to 500 chars
logger.info("Typing prompt...")
```

**After:**
```python
# Type the prompt
prompt = tweet_content  # Use full prompt
prompt_length = len(prompt)
logger.info(f"Typing prompt ({prompt_length} characters)...")

# Warn if prompt is extremely long
if prompt_length > 10000:
    logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Prompt is very long ({prompt_length} chars). This may take longer to process.")
```

### What This Fixes

‚úÖ **No more truncation** - Full prompt is sent
‚úÖ **Length logging** - See exactly how many characters are being sent
‚úÖ **Smart warning** - Only warns if prompt exceeds 10,000 characters (very rare)
‚úÖ **Better visibility** - You can see the actual prompt length in logs

## Technical Details

### Why Was 500 Characters Chosen Originally?

This appears to have been an arbitrary safety limit, possibly to:
- Prevent extremely long inputs
- Match some perceived UI limitation
- Avoid performance issues

However:
- Perplexity supports **much longer inputs** (10,000+ characters)
- Modern web apps handle long text well
- The truncation was **silent and dangerous**

### What Are Safe Limits?

| Service | Typical Character Limit |
|---------|------------------------|
| Perplexity | ~10,000+ characters |
| ChatGPT | ~8,000-16,000 characters (varies by model) |
| Claude | ~100,000+ characters |
| Twitter | 280 characters (for tweets, not API) |

### Why Remove the Limit Entirely?

1. **User knows best** - If they send a long prompt, they want it sent
2. **No silent failures** - Truncation without warning is confusing
3. **Modern limits are high** - 10,000 chars is plenty
4. **Warning for extreme cases** - Still warn at 10,000+ chars

## Code Changes Summary

**File:** `perplexity_service.py`
**Lines:** 406-413

**Changes:**
1. Removed `[:500]` truncation
2. Added `prompt_length` calculation
3. Enhanced logging to show character count
4. Added warning for extremely long prompts (>10,000 chars)

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Short Prompt (<500 chars)
```python
prompt = "Write a tweet about AI"  # 23 chars
```

**Expected Log:**
```
INFO - Typing prompt (23 characters)...
```

**Behavior:** Works exactly as before ‚úÖ

### Test Case 2: Medium Prompt (500-2000 chars)
```python
prompt = """Write a response with these rules:
1) Rule 1
2) Rule 2
3) Rule 3
...
10) Rule 10"""  # ~800 chars
```

**Expected Log:**
```
INFO - Typing prompt (800 characters)...
```

**Behavior:** NOW WORKS - Previously would be truncated at 500 ‚úÖ

### Test Case 3: Long Prompt (2000-10000 chars)
```python
prompt = """[Very detailed multi-paragraph prompt with many rules]"""  # ~5000 chars
```

**Expected Log:**
```
INFO - Typing prompt (5000 characters)...
```

**Behavior:** Works fine, no warning ‚úÖ

### Test Case 4: Extremely Long Prompt (>10000 chars)
```python
prompt = """[Massive prompt with tons of context]"""  # ~15000 chars
```

**Expected Log:**
```
INFO - Typing prompt (15000 characters)...
WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è Prompt is very long (15000 chars). This may take longer to process.
```

**Behavior:** Works, but warns user it might be slow ‚úÖ

## Expected Output Now

Run your agent:
```bash
python3 twitter_agent_selenium.py
```

**You should see:**
```
INFO - Typing prompt (1247 characters)...
INFO - üìù Prompt contains 8 newline(s)
INFO - ‚úÖ Set content with line breaks using innerHTML
INFO - ‚úÖ Successfully typed prompt: 'Write a short fact-based impactful...'
INFO - Submitting query...
INFO - Submission attempt 1/3: Re-finding input field...
INFO - ‚úÖ Query submitted with RETURN key
```

**Key difference:** The character count will show the FULL prompt length, not capped at 500

## Impact on Other Features

This fix works seamlessly with:
- ‚úÖ **Newline handling** (NEWLINE_FIX.md) - Full prompts with `\n` work
- ‚úÖ **Stale element fix** (STALE_ELEMENT_FIX.md) - Submission still robust
- ‚úÖ **HTML line breaks** - `<br>` tags still work for long prompts
- ‚úÖ **SHIFT+ENTER fallback** - Multi-line long prompts work

## Additional Notes

### If You Need to Limit Prompt Length

If you want to limit prompts for a specific reason, do it **explicitly** in your calling code:

```python
# In twitter_agent_selenium.py or wherever you call perplexity
max_length = 2000  # Your choice
if len(prompt) > max_length:
    logger.warning(f"Prompt too long ({len(prompt)} chars), truncating to {max_length}")
    prompt = prompt[:max_length]

response = perplexity.query(prompt)
```

This way:
- It's **explicit and visible**
- You control the limit
- You can adjust per use case

### Perplexity's Actual Limits

Perplexity's web interface doesn't have a hard documented character limit, but practical limits are:
- **10,000 characters**: Comfortable
- **20,000 characters**: Likely okay
- **50,000+ characters**: May hit API/UI limits

The 10,000 character warning is conservative and safe.

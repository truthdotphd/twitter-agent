# ðŸŽ¯ Premium Account Updates - Twitter Agent Browser

## âœ… **Updates Applied**

### 1. **Removed Character Limits** âœ…
**Problem**: Responses were being trimmed to 280 characters
**Solution**: Removed all character limits for premium Twitter account

**Changes Made**:
```python
# OLD PROMPT: Limited to 280 characters
"Limit the response length to 280 characters"

# NEW PROMPT: No limit for detailed responses
"Write a detailed, impactful response to the following"

# OLD CODE: Trimming responses
if len(response_text) > 280:
    response_text = response_text[:277] + "..."

# NEW CODE: Keep full response
# No character limit for premium account - keep full response
logger.info(f"Full response length: {len(response_text)} characters")
```

### 2. **Increased Perplexity Timeout** âœ…
**Problem**: 15-second timeout was too short for detailed responses
**Solution**: Increased to 60 seconds for better response generation

**Changes Made**:
```python
# OLD: 15 seconds
self.perplexity_wait_time = int(os.getenv('PERPLEXITY_WAIT_TIME', 15))

# NEW: 60 seconds
self.perplexity_wait_time = int(os.getenv('PERPLEXITY_WAIT_TIME', 60))
```

### 3. **Lowered Tweet Filter** âœ…
**Problem**: 100+ character minimum was too restrictive
**Solution**: Lowered to 30+ characters to process more tweets

**Changes Made**:
```python
# OLD: Minimum 100 characters
if len(tweet_text) < 100 or tweet_hash in self.processed_tweets:

# NEW: Minimum 30 characters
if len(tweet_text) < 30 or tweet_hash in self.processed_tweets:
```

### 4. **Full Response Preservation** âœ…
**Problem**: Responses were being truncated in multiple places
**Solution**: Removed all truncation logic to preserve complete responses

**Areas Fixed**:
- âœ… Perplexity response processing
- âœ… Tweet reply composition
- âœ… Context text creation
- âœ… Response cleaning (kept cleaning, removed trimming)

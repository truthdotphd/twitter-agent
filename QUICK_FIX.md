# Quick Fix for X.com Login Issues ✅

## The Problem (SOLVED!)
X.com was detecting the automated browser and the script conflicted with your running Chrome.

## The Solution - NOW WORKS WITHOUT CLOSING CHROME!

The script now uses a **separate Chrome profile** for automation, so you can keep your regular Chrome browser open!

### Just Run It:

```bash
python twitter_agent_selenium.py
```

**First time setup:**
1. A Chrome window will open
2. Log into X.com manually in that window
3. Log into Perplexity.ai manually
4. The script will remember your logins for future runs!

**Future runs:**
Just run the script - no manual login needed!

## How It Works

The script will now use your actual Chrome profile where you're already logged in to X.com. This avoids the bot detection entirely because you're using your real, logged-in browser profile.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **You MUST close all Chrome windows** before running the script
- The script needs exclusive access to your Chrome profile
- You must be logged into X.com in your default Chrome profile
- If you get "Chrome is already running" errors, check Activity Monitor and kill Chrome processes

## Alternative: Use Undetected ChromeDriver

If the above doesn't work, you can use a more advanced method:

```bash
# Install the undetected version
pip install undetected-chromedriver

# Create a new script or I can provide one that uses undetected-chromedriver
```

## Testing

To test if it's working:

1. Close all Chrome windows
2. Run the script
3. Watch for these log messages:
   ```
   Using Chrome profile: /Users/amirerfaneshratifar/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default
   Chrome driver initialized successfully
   Successfully logged in to X.com
   ```

If you see "No Chrome profile specified", the `.env` file wasn't loaded correctly.

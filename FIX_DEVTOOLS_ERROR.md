# Fix for DevToolsActivePort Error ✅

## What Changed

I've updated the script to **use a separate Chrome profile** for automation, so it won't conflict with your regular Chrome browser anymore!

## Quick Fix (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Close Chrome and Try Again (Quickest)

```bash
# Close all Chrome windows
./kill_chrome.sh

# Run the script
python twitter_agent_selenium.py
```

### Method 2: Run Without Closing Chrome (New!)

The script now uses a **separate automation profile**, so you can keep your regular Chrome browser open!

Just run:
```bash
python twitter_agent_selenium.py
```

**Note:** The first time you run this, a browser window will open and you'll need to:
1. Log into X.com manually
2. Log into Perplexity.ai manually
3. Then the script will remember your logins for future runs!

## What's Different Now

### Before:
- ❌ Used your main Chrome profile
- ❌ Required closing all Chrome windows
- ❌ Conflicted with your regular browsing

### After:
- ✅ Uses separate automation profile at `~/.chrome_automation_profile/TwitterAgent/`
- ✅ Can run alongside your regular Chrome
- ✅ Your logins are saved in the automation profile
- ✅ No more DevToolsActivePort errors!

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting the error?

Run these commands:
```bash
# Kill all Chrome processes
./kill_chrome.sh

# Remove any stale lock files
rm -rf ~/.chrome_automation_profile/TwitterAgent/SingletonLock
rm -rf ~/.chrome_automation_profile/TwitterAgent/SingletonSocket
rm -rf ~/.chrome_automation_profile/TwitterAgent/SingletonCookie

# Try again
python twitter_agent_selenium.py
```

### Want to use your existing Chrome profile instead?

Add this to your `.env` file:
```env
# Use your existing Chrome profile (requires closing Chrome)
CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR=/Users/amirerfaneshratifar/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome
CHROME_PROFILE_DIRECTORY=Default
```

Then close all Chrome windows and run the script.

## Technical Details

The error happens when:
1. Chrome is already running with the same profile
2. There are stale lock files from a crashed Chrome session
3. Multiple instances try to use the same profile

The fix is to use a dedicated profile for automation that doesn't conflict with your regular Chrome usage.

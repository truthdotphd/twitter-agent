# AI Response Error Detection

## Overview

The Twitter Agent now automatically detects and filters out error responses from AI assistants, ensuring only valid, useful responses are used for tweet replies.

## What's New

### 1. **Automatic Error Detection** (Line 121-186)

The agent now includes a `_is_error_response()` method that validates AI responses before using them.

#### Detected Error Patterns

The system checks for these common error messages:
- ❌ "Something went wrong"
- ❌ "An error occurred"
- ❌ "Try again" / "Please try again"
- ❌ "Sorry, I couldn't" / "Sorry, I can't"
- ❌ "I apologize" / "I'm sorry"
- ❌ "Unable to process/complete"
- ❌ "Request failed"
- ❌ "Connection/Network/Timeout error"
- ❌ "Service unavailable"
- ❌ "Internal/System error"
- ❌ "Technical difficulty"
- ❌ "Failed to load/generate"
- ❌ "Rate limit" / "Quota exceeded"
- ❌ "Too many requests"

#### Additional Validations

Beyond error messages, the system also filters out:

1. **Empty/Short Responses**
   - Responses with less than 20 characters
   - Empty or whitespace-only responses

2. **Number-Only Responses**
   - Responses that are just digits (error codes)

3. **Repetitive Content**
   - Responses where less than 30% of words are unique
   - Catches stuck or broken AI responses

### 2. **Automatic Retry Logic** (Lines 1358-1404)

When an error response is detected, the agent automatically:

1. **Detects the error** 🔍
   ```
   ⚠️ Detected error pattern: 'something went wrong' in response
   ```

2. **Refreshes the AI service** 🔄
   ```
   🔄 Refreshing CHATGPT before retry...
   ✅ Successfully refreshed CHATGPT
   ```

3. **Retries the query** 🔁
   ```
   🔄 Retry attempt 1/2 for tweet 5
   ```

4. **Validates the new response** ✅
   ```
   ✅ Got valid response from CHATGPT
   ```

### 3. **Smart Retry Strategy**

- **Max Retries**: 3 attempts per tweet
- **Between Retries**: AI service is refreshed with a new chat session
- **After All Attempts**: If no valid response is obtained, the tweet is skipped

## How It Works

### Response Flow

```
Tweet → AI Query → Response Received
                        ↓
                  Error Check
                   /        \
              Valid ✅      Error ❌
                 ↓            ↓
            Use Response   Retry (up to 3x)
                              ↓
                         Refresh AI
                              ↓
                         Try Again
```

### Example Log Output

#### Detecting Error
```
❌ Response contains error message, retrying... (attempt 1/3)
⚠️ Detected error pattern: 'something went wrong' in response
🔄 Refreshing CHATGPT before retry...
✅ Successfully refreshed CHATGPT
```

#### Getting Valid Response
```
✅ Got valid response from CHATGPT
✅ Response validation passed
```

#### After All Retries Failed
```
✗ Failed to get valid response after 3 attempts for tweet 5
```

## Configuration

### Retry Settings

The retry behavior is hardcoded but can be easily modified:

```python
# In twitter_agent_selenium.py (line 1360)
max_retries = 3  # Number of attempts before giving up
```

To change:
1. Open `twitter_agent_selenium.py`
2. Find line 1360: `max_retries = 3`
3. Change to your desired value (e.g., `max_retries = 5`)

### Debug Mode

To see detailed validation logs:

```bash
# In .env file
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

This will show:
```
✅ Response validation passed
⚠️ Response appears to be repetitive
⚠️ Response too short or empty
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Robustness** 🛡️
- No more posting error messages as tweet replies
- Automatic recovery from AI service glitches
- Handles rate limits and temporary failures

### 2. **Quality Control** ✨
- Ensures all responses are meaningful content
- Filters out broken/stuck AI responses
- Validates response quality automatically

### 3. **Unattended Operation** 🤖
- Runs reliably without manual intervention
- Automatically retries on failures
- Self-healing when AI services hiccup

### 4. **Better User Experience** 😊
- Only posts high-quality responses
- Skips problematic tweets instead of posting errors
- Maintains professional appearance

## Examples

### Before (Without Error Detection)

Tweet: "AI is transforming healthcare!"
AI Response: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
Posted Reply: "Something went wrong. Please try again." ❌ **EMBARRASSING!**

### After (With Error Detection)

Tweet: "AI is transforming healthcare!"
AI Response: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
System: ⚠️ **Detects error, refreshes AI, retries**
New Response: "AI in healthcare is revolutionizing diagnosis accuracy by 40%..."
Posted Reply: "AI in healthcare is revolutionizing diagnosis accuracy by 40%..." ✅ **PERFECT!**

    "quota exceeded",              # Quota error
    "too many requests"            # Throttling
]
```

### Adding Custom Patterns

To add your own error patterns:

1. Open `twitter_agent_selenium.py`
2. Find the `_is_error_response()` method (line 121)
3. Add your pattern to the `error_patterns` list:
   ```python
   error_patterns = [
       # ... existing patterns ...
       "your custom error pattern",
       "another pattern to detect"
   ]
   ```

## Testing

### Test the Error Detection

You can test error detection with debug output:

```python
# In Python shell
from twitter_agent_selenium import SeleniumTwitterAgent

agent = SeleniumTwitterAgent()

# Test valid response
print(agent._is_error_response("This is a great response!"))  # False

# Test error response
print(agent._is_error_response("Something went wrong."))  # True
print(agent._is_error_response("Oops! Try again later."))  # True
print(agent._is_error_response("I apologize, but..."))  # True
```

## Monitoring

### Watch for Error Detection

When running the agent, watch for these log messages:

✅ **Success**:
```
✅ Got valid response from CHATGPT
```

⚠️ **Detection**:
```
⚠️ Detected error pattern: 'something went wrong' in response
❌ Response contains error message, retrying...
```

🔄 **Retry**:
```
🔄 Retry attempt 1/2 for tweet 5
🔄 Refreshing CHATGPT before retry...
```

❌ **Failure**:
```
✗ Failed to get valid response after 3 attempts for tweet 5
```

## Statistics

When running, you can track:
- **Detected errors**: Count of `⚠️ Detected error pattern` messages
- **Successful retries**: Count of `✅ Got valid response` after retries
- **Failed tweets**: Count of `✗ Failed to get valid response after 3 attempts`

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Retries?

If you're seeing constant retries:

1. **Check AI service status**: The service might be having issues
2. **Increase wait time**: AI service might need more time to respond
   ```bash
   # In .env
   AI_WAIT_TIME=90  # Increase from default 60
   ```
3. **Check your credits**: You might be hitting rate limits

### Not Detecting Errors?

If error messages are getting through:

1. **Check the pattern**: Is your error message in the list?
2. **Add custom pattern**: See "Adding Custom Patterns" above
3. **Enable debug mode**: See if validation is running
   ```bash
   DEBUG_MODE=true
   ```

# ✅ Chrome Profile Issue FIXED!

## What Was Wrong

The script was trying to use your main Chrome profile at:
```
/Users/amirerfaneshratifar/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome
```

This caused the "chrome not reachable" error because:
1. Your main Chrome might be open (profile locked)
2. Can't connect when profile is in use
3. Session timeout after 60 seconds

## What I Fixed

✅ **Forced the script to ALWAYS use a separate automation profile**
- Location: `~/.chrome_automation_profile/TwitterAgent/`
- Never conflicts with your regular Chrome
- Completely isolated

✅ **Cleared the old automation profile**
- Removed any stale locks or sessions
- Fresh start

## Try It Now!

```bash
./run_agent.sh
```

### What Will Happen Now:

1. ✅ Uses separate automation profile (no conflicts!)
2. ✅ Chrome opens in ~5-10 seconds
3. ✅ You'll see the X.com homepage
4. ✅ Log in to X.com manually
5. ✅ Script continues automatically

### Expected Output:

```
📁 Using automation-specific Chrome profile: /Users/amirerfaneshratifar/.chrome_automation_profile
ℹ️  First time: You'll need to log into X.com manually
ℹ️  After that: Logins are remembered!
✅ Found ChromeDriver at: /Users/amirerfaneshratifar/bin/chromedriver
✅ Undetected Chrome driver initialized successfully!
```

Then Chrome opens → Log into X.com → Done!

## Why This Works Now

**Before:**
- ❌ Tried to use main Chrome profile
- ❌ Profile locked/in use
- ❌ "chrome not reachable" error

**After:**
- ✅ Uses dedicated automation profile
- ✅ No conflicts with main Chrome
- ✅ Fresh, clean profile every time if needed

---

## Run It!

```bash
./run_agent.sh
```

Chrome will open in 5-10 seconds. Just wait for it, then log into X.com! 🚀

---

## If It's Still Stuck

1. Press Ctrl+C to stop
2. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   killall "Google Chrome"
   rm -rf ~/.chrome_automation_profile
   ./run_agent.sh
   ```

This will start completely fresh!

# ✅ macOS Gatekeeper Issue FIXED!

## What Was the Problem

macOS Gatekeeper was blocking ChromeDriver with the message "chromedriver is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash."

This isn't actually damage - it's macOS security blocking unsigned executables from the internet.

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ Downloaded ChromeDriver 141 for ARM64 directly from Google
2. ✅ Installed it to `~/bin/chromedriver` (no sudo needed!)
3. ✅ Removed quarantine attributes
4. ✅ Made it executable
5. ✅ Updated script to find it there first

## ChromeDriver Location

```
~/bin/chromedriver
Version: 141.0.7390.54
Architecture: ARM64 (Apple Silicon native)
Status: ✅ Working without macOS warnings
```

## How to Run Now

Just use the run script:

```bash
./run_agent.sh
```

## What You'll See

```
🚀 Initializing undetected Chrome driver...
⏳ This may take 10-30 seconds on first run...
💻 System: macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
🌐 Detected Chrome version: 141.0.7390.55 (major: 141)
✅ Found ChromeDriver at: /Users/amirerfaneshratifar/bin/chromedriver
✅ Undetected Chrome driver initialized successfully!
🎯 This driver is designed to bypass X.com bot detection
```

## Testing ChromeDriver

You can test ChromeDriver directly:

```bash
~/bin/chromedriver --version
```

Should output:
```
ChromeDriver 141.0.7390.54 (b95610d5c4a562d9cd834bc0a098d3316e2f533f-refs/branch-heads/7390@{#2013})
```

No "damaged" or security warnings!

## Why This Works

1. **Downloaded directly** - Bypassed Homebrew quarantine
2. **User directory** - No sudo/admin needed
3. **No quarantine flag** - macOS doesn't block it
4. **Correct version** - Matches your Chrome 141.x

## Ready to Go!

Everything is set up. Just run:

```bash
./run_agent.sh
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Find ChromeDriver at `~/bin/chromedriver`
2. ✅ Use Python 3.11 from your venv
3. ✅ Use undetected-chromedriver for stealth
4. ✅ Open Chrome without any macOS warnings
5. ✅ Let you log into X.com and Perplexity.ai
6. ✅ Start processing tweets!

No more "damaged" errors! 🎉
